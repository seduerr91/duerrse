### Results of week May 4-8
- MIT project: set up sounds for the experiment, worked on plantios.github.io, had onboarding call with Josepine my project colleague, launched Google Colab infrastucture.
- DL-Scientist: Started with skill track [Image Processing](https://learn.datacamp.com/skill-tracks/image-processing), started reading through "Website Scraping with Python"; not entirely satisfied > going to work on Friday afternoon, and Sunday.
- Startup: Found amazing open source project going into my direction. Started with understanding it [here](www.writeup.ai).
- Public Voice: worked on this blog post, committed to github every day, tweeted, plantios.net.
- Leisure: Had an amazing week with G. She is so adorable.
- Extracurricular: helped Ted with the webpage of covidvoices.

# Becoming a Deep Learning Scientist
Starting from May 1, 2020, my objective is to become a deep learning engineer withtin one year. Therefore, I will work through three stages which are (1) machine learning / deep learning, (2) Kaggle competitions, and (3) open source contributions.

## Machine Learning / Deep Learning
In quarter one of my year, I will collect more certificates from DataCamp a handy data science platform.
Secondly, I will work through interesting books written by practitioners. Thirdly, I will work through the newest lecture of FastAI to make sure I learn from the state of the art in the industry.

### DataCamp
Really useful platform for getting easy access to useful ML and DL libraries.

### Practitioner Books
Usually what I purchase and find interesting.

### Fast.AI
Simply, thank you Fast.AI team!

## Open Source Contributions

It would be a dream to do pull requests for **Tensorflow** or **PyTorch**.
