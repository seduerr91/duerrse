# Becoming a Deep Learning Scientist
Starting from May 1, 2020, my objective is to become a deep learning engineer withtin one year. Therefore, I will work through three stages which are (1) machine learning / deep learning, (2) Kaggle competitions, and (3) open source contributions.

## Machine Learning / Deep Learning
In quarter one of my year, I will collect more certificates from DataCamp a handy data science platform.
Secondly, I will work through interesting books written by practitioners. Thirdly, I will work through the newest lecture of FastAI to make sure I learn from the state of the art in the industry.

### DataCamp
Really useful platform for getting easy access to useful ML and DL libraries.

Usually what I purchase and find interesting.

### Fast.AI
Simply, thank you Fast.AI team!

## Open Source Contributions

It would be a dream to do pull requests for **Tensorflow** or **PyTorch**.
