## Bildungskarenz Progress Overview

### Results of week May 4-8
- MIT project: set up sounds for the experiment, worked on plantios.github.io, had onboarding call with Josepine my project colleague, launched Google Colab infrastucture.
- DL-Scientist: Started with skill track [Image Processing](https://learn.datacamp.com/skill-tracks/image-processing), started reading through "Website Scraping with Python"; not entirely satisfied > going to work on Friday afternoon, and Sunday.
- Startup: Found amazing open source project going into my direction. Started with understanding it [here](www.writeup.ai).
- Public Voice: worked on this blog post, committed to github every day, tweeted, plantios.net.
- Leisure: Had an amazing week with G. She is so adorable.
- Extracurricular: helped Ted with the webpage of covidvoices.

### Results of week May 11-15
- MIT project: Worked on the first 6 chapters of Computer Vision with OpenCV 4, will need to continue until chapter 9. Deadline for current submission, Thursday 21, 2020, EoD.
- DL-Scientist: Finished skill track [Image Processing](https://learn.datacamp.com/skill-tracks/image-processing), continued with "Website Scraping with Python"; rather satisfied in this week, prior weeks weekend work did succeed. The next skill to study will be time series analysis. I also watched FastAI lecture 4.
- Startup: Further looked into writeup.ai. Understanding the infrastructure with technologies like concurrency, web sockets, APIs, Django Channels, etc. Will need to get it live on a docker container to see it fail :smile: and improve on it. Maybe consider looking in a book. However, I had to move to slots to the future (probably the weekend, because of the MIT deadline). Further postponing after the deadline of May 21 considerable.
- Public Voice: worked on the roadmap blog post which was concluded from strategy, committed to GitHub every day, tweeted, published plantios.net. Works gut.
- Leisure: Another fantastic week in this country. I loved our date night. Started reading Lord of the flies. Did workouts every weekday, and yoga every day. Cooked a lot.
