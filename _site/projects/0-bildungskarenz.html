<h2 id="june-2020">June 2020</h2>

<h3 id="results-of-week-june-1-5">Results of week June 1-5</h3>

<ul>
  <li>MIT project: Another presentation with Peter was due. He mentioned twice that there was quite a progress on the project. Aside, he wanted to have access to the code and to try it himself. That makes me confident that I am on a good way. He is such a strong and inspiring mentor.</li>
  <li>DL-Scientist: I learnt a lot from the MIT project this week on data science topics specifically when it comes to dealing with messy data. Next week, I will focus more on the fundamentals of Python again.</li>
  <li>Startup: I hosted my first Websocket server and I will continue with this project next Monday. Also, I will become an e-resident of Estonia.</li>
  <li>Public Voice: Blog article on traveling, but also I published the results from talking to interview experts in the field of Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.</li>
  <li>Leisure: Enjoyed beautiful long weekend in Dublin and found friends from Rotaract and have a super funny flat mate now. I am arriving in this country. The week with G. was hard for her but we made the best out of it. I like being with her a lot.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="may-2020">May 2020</h2>

<h3 id="results-of-week-may-4-8">Results of week May 4-8</h3>
<ul>
  <li>MIT project: set up sounds for the experiment, worked on plantios.github.io, had onboarding call with Josepine my project colleague, launched Google Colab infrastucture.</li>
  <li>DL-Scientist: Started with skill track <a href="https://learn.datacamp.com/skill-tracks/image-processing">Image Processing</a>, started reading through “Website Scraping with Python”; not entirely satisfied &gt; going to work on Friday afternoon, and Sunday.</li>
  <li>Startup: Found amazing open source project going into my direction. Started with understanding it <a href="www.writeup.ai">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Public Voice: worked on this blog post, committed to github every day, tweeted, plantios.net.</li>
  <li>Leisure: Had an amazing week with G. She is so adorable.</li>
  <li>Extracurricular: helped Ted with the webpage of covidvoices.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="results-of-week-may-11-15">Results of week May 11-15</h3>
<ul>
  <li>MIT project: Worked on the first 6 chapters of Computer Vision with OpenCV 4, will need to continue until chapter 9. Deadline for current submission, Thursday 21, 2020, EoD.</li>
  <li>DL-Scientist: Finished skill track <a href="https://learn.datacamp.com/skill-tracks/image-processing">Image Processing</a>, continued with “Website Scraping with Python”; rather satisfied in this week, prior weeks weekend work did succeed. The next skill to study will be time series analysis. I also watched FastAI lecture 4.</li>
  <li>Startup: Further looked into writeup.ai. Understanding the infrastructure with technologies like concurrency, web sockets, APIs, Django Channels, etc. Will need to get it live on a docker container to see it fail <img class="emoji" title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"> and improve on it. Maybe consider looking in a book. However, I had to move to slots to the future (probably the weekend, because of the MIT deadline). Further postponing after the deadline of May 21 considerable.</li>
  <li>Public Voice: worked on the roadmap blog post which was concluded from strategy, committed to GitHub every day, tweeted, published plantios.net. Works gut.</li>
  <li>Leisure: Another fantastic week in this country. I loved our date night. Started reading Lord of the flies. Did workouts every weekday, and yoga every day. Cooked a lot.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="results-of-week-may-18-22">Results of week May 18-22</h3>

<ul>
  <li>MIT project: Got the infrastructure live which was a pain in the ass. However, delivered on time. Peter was very satisfied. Read about it here <a href="https://plantions.github.io/project/2020/05/21/infrastructure.html">Leaf Identifier</a>.</li>
  <li>DL-Scientist: Worked on TimeSeries skill, and finished half a certificate but find constant difficulties of continuing to do these exercises. Will need special review to get more productive.</li>
  <li>Startup: Had to scale down because of MIT deadline but found an interesting book on my project. Hence, I will finish this book this week, and I commit to spend EUR 300 on Google Cloud Platform to get my product started next week.</li>
  <li>Public Voice: Blog article is written on coding, yet I want to take time to improve.</li>
  <li>Leisure: Difficult week for this angel but did my best to help. I followed up on my HIIT workouts and Yoga thoroughly, cooked nicely, and enjoyed the end of my quarantine by running. Can’t complain from my side.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="results-of-week-may-25-29">Results of week May 25-29</h3>

<ul>
  <li>MIT project: Video (regions of interest) and audio (MFCCs) extraction of relevant features functioning. Using Pandas DataFrames for that. Next step is trying different hyper params and correlation analysis. Worked on book Fluent Python to become a Python expert. Very amazing ground work. Will continue summarizing it.</li>
  <li>DL-Scientist: TimeSeries certificate earned. Won’t continue with DataCamp or only interesting projects as it is too highlevel by now.</li>
  <li>Startup: Got project running with Microservices by external dude. Investment of 300 EUR not reasonable at this moment. Reading into relevant books on concurrency, django projects, websockets, redis in memory databases, and JavaScript. Considering doing a JavaScript training.</li>
  <li>Public Voice: Blog article on decision-making and willpower. Consider taking a blog afternoon, next week.</li>
  <li>Leisure: Enjoyed beautiful weather in Dublin this week. Live music twice. Ran 30+ km in last 7 days, and will go for an extended run tonight (25km+); followed up on my HIIT workouts and Yoga thoroughly, cooked and prepared breakfast for G.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="review-of-month-1-of-bildungskarenz">Review of Month 1 of Bildungskarenz</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Projects: On track but I find it sometimes difficult to switch between practice (active coding) and studying (e.g., following a Datacamp session or a book). Remedy: Start with basics via ‘Fluent Python’.</li>
  <li>Interesting findings: Ireland has surprisingly nice weather. Working totally remotely works fine, and your longterm companions are just a call away. Lunch calls work perfectly fine.</li>
  <li>Roadmap alterations: Geographically, I move to the US is rather possible from the beginning of September 2020. Aside, I enjoy my time in Ireland a lot. Get away from Datacamp and high-level books and more into particular Medium publications, conference proceedings and video blogs on NLP (e.g., HuggingFace).</li>
  <li>What I liked: Being with G., virtually meeting my friends also long-term ones (e.g., Ralf, Garima), cooking a lot, calls with experts in the field.</li>
  <li>What I did not like: Sometimes feeling a bit dependent on G because I do not know anyone here; Reading ‘lord of the flies’ &gt; stop it, u German. You do not have to finish it.</li>
  <li>Optimization potential: Social hacking interventions started (relocation, local Rotaract club, join Meetups), focus more on fields you want to grow in (like deep learning) rather than ML through Datacamp. Follow plan by experts (Shouvik &amp; Jude) - which will be incorporated in new roadmap for Month 2.</li>
</ul>
