My dear friends, 

on September 28, 2021, I am turning 30 years old, and I am planning to celebrate this in a very extensive way. 
I want to rent out one to three chalets to celebrate with my closest friends during the last 30 years for a full week, making it both a celebration and a vacation.

Since I am from Bavaria and there might (it is still not cancelled) be the Oktoberfest, I thought it would be nice to have a place that allows us to reach Munich by train, but also to be in the beautiful alp mountains. 

One of my favorite places is the lake (and town) of [Tegernsee](https://goo.gl/maps/P4g53fo3mdm4BrLf6) and I would love to organize a stay there.

##### Lake Tegernsee and surrounding towns. Viewpoint Wallberg.

## Some facts
- Oktoberfest is not cancelled but scheduled for . However, there are amazing beer gardens in Munich that we could visit.
- Tegernsee beer is one of the best in the world, and the brewery is in a old monastery in the lake Tegernsee. The restaurant Bräustüberl is absolutely superb!
- There are wonderful hikes, wellness hotels, and some of Germany's nicest sights (Castle Neuschwanstein) closeby.
- I will plan 2 day/night trips to Munich (one for party/Oktoberfest; one for sight seeing).
- Luke for sure will find amazing hikes. The go-to hike however is Wallberg, Tegernsee.

## The terms
- It may seem drastic to have a whole week for the birthday of one guy, but I want you to see this as a very nice chance to have a few relaxing and physically active days with very great people in an absolutely beautiful environment. 
- Since we may be 20+ people, and a few having a far travel ahead, I would require to get a cash advance (deposit) in advance. 
- As rates I will look for a budget for 300 EUR / person, respectively 600 EUR / room per week.
