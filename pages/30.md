My dear friends, 

on September 28, 2021, I am turning 30 years old, and I am planning to celebrate this with awesome people in a very extensive way.
My plan is to rent out a few chalets to celebrate with you for minimum a full week, making it both a celebration and a vacation.

Since I am from Bavaria and as there might be the Oktoberfest taking place (it's not cancelled yet), it would be nice to have a place that allows us to reach Munich by train but also to reside in the beautiful alps. 

Matching these criteria, one of my favorite places is the lake (and town) of [Tegernsee](https://goo.gl/maps/P4g53fo3mdm4BrLf6) and I will organize a stay for us there.

###### Some facts
- Oktoberfest in Munich 2021 will begin on Saturday, 18 September and ends on Monday, 4 October. Additionally, there are amazing beer gardens in Munich that we could visit.
- Tegernsee's brewery produces one of the best beers in the world, and the brewery is in a old monastery in lake Tegernsee. The restaurant Bräustüberl is absolutely superb & authentic!
- There are wonderful hikes (Wallberg, Zugspitze), wellness options, and some of Germany's nicest sights (Castle Neuschwanstein, city of Munich) closeby. I will plan two trips to Munich (one for party/Oktoberfest; one for sightseeing).

###### The terms
- It may seem drastic to have a whole week for the birthday of one guy, but I want you to see this as a very nice chance to have a few relaxing and physically active days with very great people in an absolutely beautiful environment. I encourage to take the week of September 28 off.
- Since we may be 20+ people, and a few having a far travel ahead, I would require to get a cash advance (deposit) to secure locations. 
- As rates I will search for a budget for 300 EUR / person, respectively 600 EUR / room per week. Yet, I will consider your responses in the survey. This is a [AirBnB sample in closeby Fischbachau](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/29626740?adults=12&check_in=2021-09-18&check_out=2021-10-02&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=33b01a2b-3419-4cfc-b307-babedcc48c53).

I am so excited about this stay & my birthday celebrations with you! 

Best Regards from Mauritius,

Sebastian
