We care about the importance of reading emails that are understood by your recipient. We want them to get opened, answered, and returned positively. You too? Then read on two learn five important aspects of email writing.

Writing emails that are easy to understand and resonate with your recipient can be difficult and hard. It can also be very easy! The following five tricks will help you communicate clearly:

1. Be short.
2. Use logic.
3. Connect your ideas.
4. Use clear language.
5. Write in present.

Firstly, it helps to write __short__ and clear sentences because it takes away processing work from your reader ([at least Sciences says so](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/001088040204300204)). Secondly, logical cues such as ("next" :smile:) help the reader to follow your thoughts ([read here why](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43090348?seq=1)). Third, if you ever feel like your thoughts are unrelated - do not worry. Just try to connect them with infilling an additional sentence. Bridging ideas helps to never lose track on your red threat ([read more](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1001181927857)).

Fourth, using simple and clear langauge helps to understand you and is very essential. Imagine a person has to look up a term to understand you. Do not take away their [concentration](https://www.fd.unl.pt/docentes_docs/ma/AGON_MA_25849.pdf) like that. Fifth, you are communicating clearly if you write in present (wherever applicable). This produces a sence of presence and makes your message more tangible ([read here why](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-012-0258-1)).

Luckily, all these aspects can be supported or achieved with aritificial intelligence (AI) today. At Persuaide, we have features that cover the five tricks presented in this article.
