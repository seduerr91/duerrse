This article introduces...
- findings my experiences with different object detection and tracking tools
- with a focus on PlantCV's capabilities,
- lists the new videos I created for further analysis, and
- introduces to my concept for the next steps.

### Object detection and tracking tools

Algorithm name | plantCV | MeanShift & Kalman | GoodFeaturesToTrack
---|---|---|---
Use Case|Designed for detecting plants and their pieces.|For moving objects such as cars or human faces.|For recognizing edges. Not for entire object detection.

Conclusion: GoodFeaturesToTrack by far the best to spot results and to track movement on an stationary camera.
PlantCV allows to determine specific plant related features.
