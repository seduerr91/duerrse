"To be persuasive we must be believable; to be believable we must be creditableâ€‹; to be credible we must be truthful." - _Edward R. Murrow_

_Do you want to have the power to clearly articulate what you want to say? Do you want others to understand yoi, and eventually give you what you ask for? Do you want to get your messages answered, and your efforts to be appreciated?_

In our [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05786) from January 2021, we identified a variety of determinants that influence the persuasiveness of a message. In this article, we explain in non-academic terms what matters when trying to write in a persuasive way: Write messages that are believable, credible, and truthful.
 
Firstly, create beliefs with __Logic__. Using logical connectors helps to be more structured and help to connect one's arguments. Logical terms are: then, next, another, besides, and, or, instead, ...).
Logic and arguments allow to predict beliefs regarding the conclusion of a reasoning. The theorists [McGuire 1981]() and [Wyer 1970]() explain that believing in premises leads to the expectation that a specific conclusion will follow. Furthermore, if a message inspires a perceptual change in the truth of a believe, then a change in perceiving the conclusion is expected.

Secondly, you want to provide help to your recipient, so that they also help you. This __credibility__ needs to be earned. Therefore, your recipient needs to have a positive attitude towards you. In emails you can provide help by, for example, summarizing what your recipient previously wrote to you (AI can help you with that - [learn how](duerr.se/blog/tools)). Alternatively, you can use outcome phrases (e.g., expressed via sentence structures such as: finally, in conclusion) or cues of scarcity (e.g., giving a deadline: next week Monday). This way, you provide help trough orientation to your recipient as he understands what to do when (temporality) and what is ultimately important (usually revisited in conclusions).

The third aspect is __truth__. Your recipient will collaborate with you, if you create a sense of trust. Trust can be created by being friendly, being interested or talking in the words of your recipient. 
- Being friendly can be achieved through writing thank you and please whenever applicable.
- Showing interest for your recipient can be achieved through asking open questions such as 'How should we proceed with the following topic?' or 'What is your opinion on this topic?'
- Importantly, talk in the words of your recipient! For this you can either paraphrase what he has written to you, if you have an earlier message or you should make sure that you use the second and third person (you, them, their) rather than the first (I, me, mine, etc). 

This way your recipient feels acknowledged and taken for granted. You create empathy trust as a precursor to their truth.

We illustrated the importance of truthful, credible and believable message writing. At Persuaide, we evaluate how your email compares to 20.000 other persuasive mails in that category. Our persuasiveness score demonstrates how frequently you use words of logic, goodwill, and trust. To identify your score, just insert a persuasive message into our editor.
