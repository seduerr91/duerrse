"To be persuasive we must be believable; to be believable we must be creditableâ€‹; to be credible we must be truthful." - _Edward R. Murrow_

Do you want to have the power to clearly articulate what you want to say so that others understand, and eventually give you what you ask for? Do you want to get your messages answered, and your efforts to be appreciated? Write messages that are believable, credible, and truthful.

In our [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05786) from Janurary 2021, we identified a variety of determinants that influence the persuasiveness of a human. In this article, we explain in non-academic terms what matters when trying to write in a persuasive way. 

Firstly, create believability with __Logic__. Using logical connectors helps to be more structured and help to connect one's arguments. Logical terms are: then, next, another, besides, and, or, instead, ...).
Logic and arguments allow to predict beliefs regarding the conclusion of a reasoning. The theorists (McGuire 1981, Wyer 1970) explain that believing in premises leads to the expectation that a specific conclusion will follow. Furthermore, if a message evokes a perceptual change in the truth of a believe, or additional premises are supplemented a change in perceiving the conclusion is expected.

Secondly, you want to provide help to your recipient, so that they also help you. You want your recipient to have a positive attitude towards you. In emails you can provide help by, for example, summarizing what your recipient previously wrote to you. Alternatively, you can use outcome phrases (e.g., expressed via sentence structures such as: finally, in conclusion) or cues of scarcity (e.g., deadline, later, next week) to provide conclusions or temporality. This way you provide help trough orientation to your recipient as he understands what to do when (temporality) and what is ultimately important (written in conclusions).

The third aspect is truthful. Your recipient will collaborate with you if you create a sense of trust. Trust can be created by being friendly, being interested or talking in the words of your recipient. Being polite can be achieved through writing thank you and please whenever applicable. Showing interest for your recipient can be achieved through asking open questions such as 'How should we proceed with the following topic?' or 'What is your opinion on this topic?'
One of the most exciting aspects is talking in the words of your recipient. For this you can either paraphrase what he has written to you, if you have an earlier message or you should make sure that you use more emphatic terms in the second and third person (you, them, their) than in the first person (I, me, mine, etc). This way your recipient feels acknowledged and taken for granted.
