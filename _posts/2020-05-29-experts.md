### Coding foundations
- Statistic & ML Fundamentals: work through the book ‘Introduction to Statistical Learning’.
- Coursera Course: Andrew Ng’s course on Machine Learning from [Stanford](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)
- Software Engineering: work on product deployment: Study on Writeup.ai (e.g., Startup Scripts); an intro is the book ‘Monetize Machine Learning’.
- Udacity Course: Preparing for [Coding Interviews](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-career-guide-interview-preparation/)
- Public Voice:
    - Blogging is useful if you present in a nice way - recruiters may find it useful and intuitive # To Do: Make sure to make videos as they are easy to understand.
    - Make scientific contributions.

### Coding Language Proficiency
- Programming Languages: Python, C, JavaScript
- Python:
    - Become expert in fundamentals by carefully reading ‘Fluent Python’
    - Work on Python 101 Challenges (e.g., hacker rank, leet code)
- JavaScript: Do few courses on [TeamTreehouse](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/100-days-of-code/?_ga=2.238278912.1635496758.1590398997-278633462.1590221785)
- C: Read the [C-Python Article](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101/EssentialC.pdf) from Stanford
- Additionally: Get proficient in relevant skills: Concurrency, Micro-Services with Django, Redis, Websockets, JS React.

### NLP - Deep Learning Applications
- Deep Dive
    - Read fundamentals: the ‘illustrated transformer’ [blog post](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)
    - HuggingFace
        - Revise paper review from [Thomas Wolf](https://youtu.be/G5lmya6eKtc) as of April, 2020.
        - Review and watch their additional videos.
    - Architectures: Understand LSTM and further architectures, read papers on that/Medium articles
- Academic material
    - Join MIT classes on NLP / Deep Learning in Winter and Spring Term
    - Check for material from Girafski & Chris Manning: look in their research papers / read their books

#### Side notes:
- Reminder: MIT squeeze a lot out of it because of all the connections and job opportunities. Focus on doing research.
- Startup: Focus carefully, do not make it take out time too much; may prevent you too much on working on deep learning aspects.
- Kaggle industry perspective: consists of loads of dummy datasets, companies do not necessarily put a lot of weight on Kaggle because data is too clean.
- Focus: Find your focus in the deep learning world like NLP only.
- Potential future role: Forward Deployment Engineer: Consulting & Engineering, e.g. implementing and presenting PoCs.
