There are different decoding methods which are _Greedy Search_, _Beam Search_, _Top-K sampling_, and _Top-p sampling_.

The Greedy algorithm selects a word with the highest probability as the next word.

Beam Search chooses a word structure that has the highest probability of a defined number of beams. It uses ngrams to avoid repetitions.

Sampling top-k gives the most likely next word by redistributing the probability mass among the K next words. 

Top-p sampling chooses from the smallest possible set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds the probability p. The probability mass is then redistributed among this set of words.
