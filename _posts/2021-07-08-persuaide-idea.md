## Understand Persuaide's Idea

Imagine you are getting an angry message from your customer. 
Naturally, youâ€™ll be writing a response in which you try to make her happy based on gut feeling.

Our tool will create a psychological profile of this customer message, check for her formality and writing clarity.
Then, once you drafted your response, we will scan this draft for certain phrases and our tool will give you suggestions on how to be more persuasive.

For instance, it helps to write in subjunctive to introverts whereas extroverts need activating language.
How can you be sure that it works? 
Well, science proves it. 

Do you want to become part of the movement that writes based on your recipient but not on gut feeling?
Then join our waiting list and change the way the world communicates. 

We are Persuaide.
