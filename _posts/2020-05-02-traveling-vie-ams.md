## Traveling 14 hours by train with stops in WÃ¼rzburg, Duesseldorf, and Venlo towards Amsterdam Airport
# What did I do?

Morning:
- sent out mail to Josephine
- worked on infrastructure for bildungskarenz in trello
- looked for nice templates for web pages: bonmot.co could use  anew one but decided to stick with current but have a subpage on which tool can be used for free anyways
- got plantios.io started and added some input
- checked how to create a 24 min video with python or audacity
