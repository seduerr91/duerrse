# Why can't Compliance just say yes?

The nation-wide marketing campaign was set up for Wednesday, and they put a lot of budget into it and the product. Marketers and management kept on asking if the  deadline will be kept. We said: Everybody gave their approval weeks ago, only compliance does not get back to us. We contacted them so many times! Yet, on Friday afternoon before that designated Monday, we still needed to get their approval. I had to somewhat sync these people to get approval by compliance and to roll-out the product. Why couldn't things be easier?

# The task at hand

Rewind to February that year: The steering committee of my project stream (consisting of fourteen different projects mostly banking products) instructed me to _roll-out an online credit card product_.  This means that in my role as a Chief Product Owner, I have to orchestrate a lot of resources:

- web developers & web designers,
- business & requirements analysts,
- marketing & internal communications,
- IT operations & business operations,
- legal & compliance,
- while constantly keeping the steering committee in the loop)

throughout summer to get the product live.

# Getting the Project Setup

Before starting even ideating the online product application process in February, business analysts were instructed to evaluate the market, conduct competitor analyses, and to agree on the terms of the banking product. Usually, it is most fruitful to get as many people as possible to contribute to a central Confluence page by briefing everybody, demanding them to deliver their input. This usually makes people happy to contribute. For that, you often need some extra rounds of consolidation, to make sure key stakeholders allocate their time to your project. It is always key to also bring legal on board. Also, compliance was part of it, but they were relaxed.

After jotting down specifications and getting funding to start the development in March, it was important to have a design thinking workshop still in February. In this, the customer journey would be mapped against the products specifications, the limitations of our IT infrastructure, and the input of the UX designers.  I constantly made sure, that we find the best compromises for everyone to get towards an MVP and dealing with conflicting but less relevant matters later.

# The Product Development & Roll-out Phase

During the actual development of the product, the task of a Chief Product Owner involves follow up with product owners and resolving impediments that the product owner cannot resolve given his hierarchy level. There are be issues weekly, and it is key to mentally read people that created impediments. Reading into psychology and keeping a fresh spirit by doing sports frequently really helps to remain 'cognitively flexible'.

Besides, bi-weekly reporting to the steering committee, constant communications to the business stakeholders about the product's development progress, and being responsible for two additional development teams made my days run by quickly. Happily, two business analysts would assist and that would take care of many organizational matters. This way, I could focus on managing people to get work to be done.

Closer to the roll-out date, it have to coordinate the approval cascade of fifteen individual items involving:
- IT: getting IT security clearance, releasing, IT operations,
- Management: steering committee & sponsors,
- Business: legal, compliance, communications, and, marketing.

For this purpose, be persuasive: Have a deck of elegant slides on the subject and its functionality to proactively resolve all the little comments, individual requirements, and questions you would get. A central trait is to be reliable, solution-oriented, and credible because you need trust of all entities to progress.

# Forming Alliances if There is Resistance

There are always managers that do not support your ideas, so isolate them and manipulate them by using the cascade of escalation and a mix of time pressure within the hierarchical structure of the cooperation to succeed. This often means to brief everyone else in advance of a meeting and to make sure they all know what to vote for! This leaves these "special" managers with no alternative rather than also giving consent.

I managed to get everything orchestrated rightly and timely, and had a solid MVP close to the end of the project plan. Yet, we were still waiting for approval of the compliance department (surprisingly it was not the legal department this time). This is when things got interesting. Given little time, it just made sense to get in touch with the head of compliance who was like three levels above me. We could find - and, therefore, I truly love Austria - a solution over a coffee.

# Celebrate your Successes

While we had to make sure that all the other projects are running and have enough workload, I invited the project team for a nice steak dinner to celebrate our success. As a conclusion, I admit that the complexity of my former job would never come from the project or product but majorly from all the fish swimming in any large corporation and the need to politically act and navigate everybody (or the greater majority) towards one common direction for success.

Disclaimer: Without my amazing assistants, and my product owners such successes would have never been possible.
Annotation: I am now on a full-year leave to become a machine learning engineer in collaboration with the MIT in Boston. I truly believe in the powers of deep neural networks and, therefore, I deem it of the utmost importance to be prepared for the future. My bosses and the steering board were not happy to see me leave for a year but I know it is the right thing to do and so they accepted my leave.
