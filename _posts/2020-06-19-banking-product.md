# Introduction

The nation-wide marketing campaign was set up for Wednesday, and they put a lot of budget into it and the product. Marketers and management kept on asking if the roll-out deadline will be kept. Yet, on Friday afternoon before that designated Wednesday, we still needed to get the final approval by the head of compliance and his boss the CEO. This CEO of a bank with approx. 50.000 employees globally, had an appointment in the Austrian national bank, and my strongest support was currently in the United States of America for a business trip (Head of IT of the biggest regional bank). I had to somewhat sync these people to get approval by compliance and to ultimately roll-out the product. Why couldn't things be easier?

# The task at hand

Rewind to February that year: The steering committee (consisting of eight different major banks) of my project stream (consisting of fourteen different projects mostly banking products) instructed me to _roll-out an online credit card product with very little manual interactions_.  This means that in my role as a Chief Product Owner, I have to orchestrate a lot of resources (web developers, web designers, business and requirements analysts, marketing, internal communications, IT operations, business operations, legal, compliance, while constantly keeping the steering committee in the loop) throughout summer to get the product live. To complicate things, marketing planned a nation-wide marketing campaign and decided to make it an integral part of this campaign.

# Setting up projects

Before starting even ideating the online product application process, business analysts were instructed to evaluate the market, conduct competitor analyses, and to agree on the terms of the banking product. Usually, it was most fruitful to get as many people as possible to contribute to a central Confluence page by briefing everybody, demanding them to deliver their input and to have very structured meetings so that everybody feels accommodated and taken seriously in the process. This usually makes people happy to contribute. For that, you often need some extra rounds of consolidation, to make sure key stakeholders allocate their time to your project. In this case, it was key to also bring the sector's lawyers on board to not get stopped later. Also, compliance was part of it, but they were not too critical with the concept of the product.

After setting up the specifications and getting funding to start the project, it was important to quickly start with an ideation workshop in which the customer journey would be mapped against the products specifications, the limitations of our IT infrastructure, and the input of the UX designers and external experiments with test people. Ideally, such a product development in an ideation workshop would start from scratch but in banking with existing products and running manual in-branch processes, you cannot question everything if you ever want to steer everyone towards one central goal: rolling out a credit card product. Therefore, we made sure we find the best compromise for everyone to get towards an MVP and dealing with conflicting but irrelevant topics later.

# The task at hand s

So after two very stressful days, we had a virtual click-dummy that would immediately be shared with all the entities, including the law department (for the integration of checkboxes), the business side (to challenge the process and, e.g. to double-check that we are not forgetting any inputs for rating,), the development team (to reiterate feasibility and giving an estimation about the scope of the product given the fixed timeframe we had) and a bunch of more people for coordination purposes.

During the actual development of the product, the task of a Chief Product Owner would largely involve weekly follow up with the responsible product owner and resolving major impediments that the product owner of the development team would not be able to resolve given his ranking in the hierarchy. There would be matters every week, and it was key to mentally read these people that created impediments because they always wanted to use you as a tool. Luckily, reading into psychology and keeping a fresh spirit by doing sport frequently makes sure you are not falling into this trap.  
Impediments often relate to key development resources that are occupied in another way, and so it is key to start alliances around these resources to ensure they were working and fulfilling their tasks. Besides, bi-weekly reporting to the steering committee, constant communications to the business stakeholders about the product's development progress, and being responsible for two additional development teams made my days run by quickly. Happily, two business analysts would assist me exclusively and that would take care of many organizational matters like meeting scheduling, workshop preparations, and follow-ups so that I could focus on managing people to get the actual work to be done during my many workshops and to navigate our numerous stakeholders.  

Closer to the day of the roll-out, it was my duty to coordinate the approval cascade of fifteen individual items involving getting IT security, product managers from IT and business side, UX designers, steering committee, sponsors, legal, compliance, releasing, IT operations, communications, marketing, collaborating companies onto the same bus by approving. For this purpose, it was key to participate in very comprehensive Q&A meetings, and to have a deck of shiny elegant slides on the product and its functionality, and to proactively resolve all the little comments, individual requirements, and questions you would get. I guess central learning of this process was to be very reliable, solution-oriented, and credible because we always needed the trust of these entities to progress.

Admittedly, there were few managers and resources that would not support our approach but it was usually good to isolate them and massaging them using the cascade of escalation and a mix of time pressure within the hierarchical structure of the cooperation to succeed. This sometimes also meant to brief everyone in person except this one stubborn manager in advance of a meeting and to make sure they all know what to vote for when it comes to decision making for the sake of leaving this one manager with no alternative rather than also giving consent.

Also, a lot of stones would be thrown on your way masked as super important essential requirements, and it helped to proactively unmask these as scope creep, and by informing sponsors that this additional burden would jeopardize the roll-out timeline and that it would be beyond the originally discussed MVP.

Given the fact, that I had a year of experience, amazing colleagues (and already learned a lot as an assistant in two such projects before), we managed to get everything orchestrated rightly and timely, and had a solid MVP close to the end of the project plan. Yet, we were still waiting for approval of the compliance department (surprisingly it was not the legal department this time). This is when things got interesting.

We only had a couple of days until the marketing-effective roll-out was scheduled but we learned that the compliance department was not happy with one mini identification sub-step because of a contract that has not been signed for three years. Due to the NDA, I am not allowed to go into the nitty grittiness of this contract but it was in Part B, annotation 3, amendment 8 of a legal document that was not signed by the eight regional banks for years, and they wanted to abuse my project to get it finally done. However, this was the first time, I ever heard of the document. I was surprised. How could they not learn about that earlier? How could they not inform me? How could they not deal with it? Why should I also take care of legal matters?

Well, given the little time it just made sense to not be unhappy about finding this out but to find a solution. Therefore, I got in touch with the head of compliance who was like three levels above me. We could find - and, therefore, I truly love Austria - a formal solution if all the heads of the steering committee would submit a formal approval mail to the legal department. This way, compliance could accept the product. Next, good luck trying to convince eight different top managers (Head of IT of Bank A, Head of Markets of Bank B, ...) to sign something very spontaneously on a Friday at 5 PM. Yet, they all would respond immediately given their high rank, and it was very helpful to get a very influential manager from the biggest bank onboard first just to be persuasive towards the others. For convincing the influential manager, we got the CEO of the bank with its 50.000 employees on board - the one I mentioned earlier in the introductory part - and managed to roll-out the project in time.

While we had to make sure that all the other projects are running and have enough workload, I invited the project team for a nice steak dinner to celebrate our success. As a conclusion, I admit that the complexity of my former job would never come from the project or product but majorly from all the fishes that are swimming in this large corporation and the need to politically act and navigate everybody (or the greater majority) towards one common direction for success.

Disclaimer: Without my amazing assistants, and my product owners such successes would have never been possible.
Annotation: I am now on a full-year leave to become a machine learning engineer in collaboration with the MIT in Boston, to be able to code and to be equipped for the future and all the projects that are awaiting me in the future. I truly believe in the powers of deep neural networks and, therefore, I deem it of the utmost importance to be prepared for the future. My bosses and the steering board were not happy to see me leave for a year but I know it is the right thing to do and so they accepted my leave.
