The ethical use of AI in a noble and non-dentrimental way is a challenge. Mentally combine ethical AI with  persuasion technology and you may wonder if the people behind Persuaide are insane. There are reports of technical interference (Brexit campaign, US elections) in which artificial intelligence had a profound impact. 

In this article we will outline that our technology platform has the capability to impact individual commiunication. However, we outline our commitment to ensure that Persuaide is for noble purposes. This matters so much to us that we it became part of Persuaide's moral code. This is our excerpt regarding __Responsible and Ethical AI__:

_"We are committed to AI responsibility. We believe that Artificial Intelligence is powerful and should only be used ethically and for the benefit of human life. It should never be used to the detriment of one individual over another. To ensure transparency, we commit to openly educate society about our work and the theories behind our algorithms. Second, we commit to working closely with our customers to ensure that our software is used only for the benefit of all humanity and never to the advantage of one individual over another."_

In the following, we address the transparency to educate society about our works and the theories behind central algorithms. Last, we communicate how we ensure that our software is used only for the benefit of all humanity. Let us begin.

Persuaide is a platform that allows everyone to communicate better with the help of artificial intelligence. Our __work__ is based on soundly defined academic evidence.

In order to understand how persuasion and technology (i.e. natural language processing or generation) can be combined, we conducted a [literature review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05786) to understand the complexities of the two fields. In brief, we identified some fifty determinants that explain how people are susceptible in different ways to persuasion and specific types of communication. These are clustered into four categories benevolence, linguistic appropriacy, logical argumentation and trustworthiness. Persuaide minds these determinants and has them implemented in their code base.

Next, we also want to understand how humans actually adapt texts or emails to make them more persuasive. Therefore, we conducted an experiment ([Read the study here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12454)) that allowed us to identify adaptations that make a text more persuasive.Consequently, we theorize successful persuasiveness in Natural Language Generation (Duerr & Gloor 2021, p. 11) as the alignment of tonal formality, emotionality, and comprehensiveness with a recipient in a structured and logically coherent manner in a text. Persuaide minds these findings and has them implemented in their code base.

In regard of __theories__, we relate to four major ones. These are the Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (Festinger 1957), Language Expectancy Theory (Burgoon et al. 2002), Probabilistic Models (Wyer 1970), and Balance Theory (Heider 1958).
 
Festinger’s Theory of Cognitive Dissonance focuses a persuadee's perceived benevolence which can be dissonant, consonant, or irrelevant to each other. The magnitude of dissonance determines one’s motivation to reduce it.

_Language Expectancy Theory_ language expectancy theory identifies written or spoken language as rule-based system. Expectations are often consistent with sociological and cultural norms. Preferences tend to relate to societal standards and cultural values. Negative expectations inhibit persuasion, e.g., when persuader makes use of language considered socially unacceptable.

The third central theory pertains to _probalistic models_. Probability models are based on the rules of formal logic and probability. They predict beliefs regarding the conclusion of reasoning. Beliefs can be ascertained through subjective probabilities.

Lastly, _balance theory_ focuses on the relationship between persuader and persuadee. The persuadee's attitude towards the persuader can be balanced or unbalanced. If it is in balance, then a persuader has greater chances for persuasion.

The third part of this article, is on how we ensure that our software is used only for the benefit of all humanity. Certainly, we are not able to fully control how humans use our platorm. Therefore, we have measures implemented that prevent inappropriate usage scenarios. This way, we avoid the misuse of Persuaide and debiasing through three major layers. 

Firstly, every data point that we process is being checked for politically inappropriate or potentially offensive language. We collated a wide range of inappropriate terms, and in order to keep our algorithms clean and avoid model drift, we are rejecting any data processing in the presence of such terms. Our ethical officer had a great time optimizing and collating this list.

Secondly, we have deep neural nets in place that scan statements for hate speech and subconscious biases. Our technology identifies concepts such as irony, sarcasm and potential elements of hatred or cultural inacceptabilities in them. 

Thirdly, we are using anonymization algorithms to never process any personal data in our deep neural nets. The inherent complex and large scale transformer architectures that we are using do make tracing of certain texts computationally very expensive, and, therefore, almost impossible but on top of that we use masking and alteration algorithms that make sure that a plethora of entities, e.g. names, company names and geographical locations, are always anonymized.

Also with our threefold approach, we cannot guarantee a 100% bias free algorithmic approach but internal experiments conducted with ethical AI experts and consultations of digital privacy laywers allow us to be convinced that we filter out 99% of inappropriateness. We confidently can say that we are using state of the art measures to ensure that Persuaide remains ethical.

At Persuaide, we set on a mission to help everybody to become better at communication.
Thank you,

Your team from Persuaide
