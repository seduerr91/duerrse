description: Concluding a roadmap from your personal strategy.

### Introduction: If you got a plan then you can change it. If you do not have any, then you hardly can change.

Last week I talked about strategy, this is second part how to conclude a roadmap from this. Building on my experience as a bank manager I learnt how to set up projects, conclude them from the corporate strategy, set KPIs and targets, and control them diligently. Why would I not do this to myself? 
Try to share how to approach this. 
Firstly, once you got your strategy, i.e. you outlined where you want to be in 5 years, then you can conclude a vision from it. So let us start what I mean by vision.

### Vision

When crafting my visions I did not think of a single vision but of four different callings that I see myself in one years time. For every single calling, I had to make sure that it aligns with my overall strategy for 2025. You can think of your strategy like a mountain. The peak is there to be reached in 2025, and there are certainly some key KPIs that will guide me to this summit, however, everybody knows that happiness is not in the peak. It is in the process of gradually climbing towards the peak. Therefore, you outline visions that you think will guide you there and you evaluate them. The beauty is that they are not fixed over five years, but the callings that you list and set for one year. They are. You should keep them as fixed as possible to make sure you truly look into them.

I added one additional aspect, I want to make sure that I have fun and enjoy my life. Sometimes it is hard for me to do so because I am so focussed on all these wonderful ideas out there so I added it as a fith item *or calling* as part of my vision. 

As an example for a vision, I take owning a credible public voice. By that I mean that in one years time, I want to have published quite some blog articles, to have a profound name in a dedicated sphere, let us say deep learning, but also on other aspects like motivation or traveling.

### Objectives & Premises 

Once, you have your visions make it two to four to keep some flexibility you can further break them down in objectives that you have to achieve within the set time period *for me a year*. This will then allow you to have work packages later that you want to integrate in your roadmap. 
Coming back to above example, the objectives that I conclude to owning a credible public voice is to build a public image. Two conclusions from this are to regularly publish articles on the blog you are currently at, and to additionally later  publish on more frequented web pages like 'Medium' and to even visualize my thoughts on Youtube.

However, I made sure that I put some premises on the same page where I put my objectives. Why? Because you have to find certain agreements with yourself to make sure that you can follow up on your visions. Quite literally, I wrote down that one should 'love yourself', 'stay focused', and to remain 'strategy aligned'. 

__Loving yourself__ is being associated with knowing what does one good (for me it is sports, sleeping eight hours per night, and to eat healthy).
__Staying focused__ pertains to meditate and, thus, reflect on a regular base, to make sure you are in balance, run a frequently because it allows me to take a different approach to my activities, and to do yoga recurrently to stay flexibly both physically and mentally.

Lastly, __strategy aligned__ refers to keep the goals that I set for myself for this whole year of 2020 (only valid in this year) but also to track my progress of my study leave dilligently. For that, I am keeping a diary, and send out a tweet '@duerrseb' everyday. Additionally, I will make sure every quarter if my behavior still aligns with my strategy 2025 or if my interventions or my strategy may be worth an update.

### Temporal roadmap

Next, I drew my aspects on a roadmap to give it a temporal structure, and a comprehensive overview. **This is the very central aspect because it allows everybody to get a quick but powerful insight**. This is important because you want to have certain milestones, and / or gates that will nudge you into reviewing your current path. For instance, for bonmot.co, I want to review on a quarterly base if it still makes sense to follow this trajectory or to maybe pivot into another idea. 
Secondly, with public voice, I set little dots for every week as I am intending to publish an article every week.

### Work packages

Having then a temporal perspective on my objectives, it is time to ideate different work packages that will help you achieving your directions. For that, I consulted friends, experts, and brainstormed quite a bit of the course of weeks, and during vacations, to make sure I am going on a good path. You can do certainly a lot of things but so often it is important to do the right things, and to do them right. Hence, I particularly made sure I learn from the narrations of people to conclude my work packages. Once, I identified them and listed them in an excel (it contains 23 tasks), I ordered and structured them, and defined different metrics. These are: - frequency: how often will I need to work on that?
- target outcome: what will I do for it regularly?
- progress KPI: what tells me that I am progressing?
- ressource backlog: where do I store ideas / results?
- hours per week: how many hours will I allocate to the task?
- starting quarter: when does it make sense to start with the task?
- ending quarter: when should I focus on the next task within the stream?
- deadline frequency: when are specific dates that I need to submit?

### Weekly schedule

By filling out this table, I made sure I have enough hours during the week but also during the year in order to find time for the different tasks. Once, set up and shifting them into the different quarters, I started to create a school style like weekly calendar that stays rather fixed for minimum a month, to make sure that I work on my objectives every day. This really helps to have something fixed in your calender because it really holds you accountable.

### Deadlines

Additionally, I - on a separate slide - also extracted the deadlines for a given quarter, to make sure I got the deliverables per quarter on one slide, and to mind that.

### Enforcing your commitments

Lastly, to make sure I do not disregard my schedule, I added a slide that I named 'Statement of Compliance' on which I outlined a penalty - donating a significant amount of money to a charity that I do not really like, added some exceptions, like sickness, necessities due to this current pandemic, and asked to friends to support me with this whole roadmap. They receive a mail from me every week in which I outline what I did, and if I am happy with what I achieved.

### Special Perk: Communicate it to your friends

Lastly, I made a very beautiful slide deck from my plans to make sure that I can present it. I did pitch it to my closest friends so that they can evaluate my plans, and give me feedback. It is very valuabe what they voiced. 

### Conclusion

Two weeks have passed by now, and I can tell that it is a lot of tasks but I absolutely love that I got time to work on projects that matter so much to me personally.
