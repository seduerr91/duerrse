Small things: All the little decisions each and every single day.
What do you need for it?
- Sleep: fixed hours, 7-8 hours else intoxicated, airplane mode
- Healthy food: banana instead of chocolate, fruits and veggies, water
- Cardio sport: swimming, running, cycling.

### How do you get into a routine?
