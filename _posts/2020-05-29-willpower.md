Imagine you are presented with the choice to eat a donut or a banana. Which of the two delights would you pick?
Would you go with the fluffy and warm donut or the boring banana? Thinking of the donut ...? :wink:

### Making the Right Decisions

Often, people select donuts over a banana because they know that you are not going to wake up unhealthy tomorrow. Yet, this is quite a paradox.
While the little decisions that we make each day, do not impact us in the short run, the do in the long run. Hence, paradoxically very little decisions do matter completely because they compound. This can be both

- motivating: only small smart decisions for long and it will pay back with e.g. having a strong immune system, respectively
- frustrating: if you make healthy decisions like let us say you start running every day but you only improve in speed over weeks.

Yet, subconsciously, we know that we want to reap the benefits of our decisions, like being long-term healthy, mindful, and _as research recurrently proves_ happy.
So how do you make good decisions? Usually, it helps to have a certain level of will power. Will power means having the capacity to make the right decisions through and through. However, will power is like a muscle that can deplete as you may have encountered when choosing and shopping for cloth for a few hours. Hence, it is important to train this 'muscle' to ensure that you can always consciously choose the glass of water, the fruit or the salad option over the lemonade, chocolate or greasy fast-food burger.

### How Do You Train Will Power?

Years ago, I researched how humans can start making healthy small decisions to benefit over the long run? Recurrently, research shows that there are three simple bulbs that we need to illuminate every day because they help us to be happy. These bubbles are sufficient sleep, healthy nutrition, and cardio sports activities. Let us elaborate a bit on this.

- **Sufficient sleep**: If you sleep less than six hours over a longer period then people tend to make decisions like children. Also, people that lack sleep show the symptoms of being mildly intoxicated which clouds optimal decision-making. To sleep (and to fall asleep) sufficiently the following trips help: Keep a tight sleep schedule where you go to bed roughly at the same time each night and roughly wake up at the same time each morning. This should encompass a minimum of seven and a maximum of eight hours. Sleep research also uncovered that sleeping more than eight hours may have adverse effects too as you may be in bed too long which can bad for your back. Once, you go to bed around midnight every night and wake up around eight in the morning, your body truly gets used to it which allows it to rest easily and fall asleep quickly. Also, it helps to turn on flight mode on your phone during night time to make sure you are not disrupted by friends or anything.
- Secondly, keeping a **healthy nutrition** allows you to make the right decisions. When, we eat fruits, veggies, light meat, or fish dishes (with little butter, oil, or, fats) our body is less stressed by digesting and processing these difficult inputs, and likewise sources more energy from the vitamins that usually encompass these ingredients. A nice side-effect certainly is that you would also cumulate fewer calories :wink:.
- Lastly, **endurance sports**, e.g., swimming, running, or cycling, positively moderate the ability to make decisions and to cope with stress. People who pursue sports activities focusing on stamina are usually more balanced and able to keep stress at a distance once they are supposed to make decisions, e.g. at work. Additionally, sportsmen and women also benefit from the ability to reflect on themselves once they are doing endurance sports because you can do fairly little things aside running, for instance. Magically, you can also not worry while you are doing activities that boost your stamina, try it out, you will not be able to.

After having stated these benefits of these bulbs that humans should ignite, one may wonder how to maintain them over a longer period? Make them a routine!

### How do you get into a routine?

There is also an answer and practice to this. In the past, researchers proved that twenty days is usually sufficient time to build up routines, and maintaining them like: If you manage to keep practice for twenty days, you will be able to keep it forever. Usually, this concept proves very useful if you are trying to learn something new, too. The only difficulty arises from setting up such a schedule. Normally, I set up an Excel table that allows me to share it with friends that hold me accountable. This document is structured with boxes to tick each day, to ensure I follow strictly. To ensuring this strict following, I usually integrate a penalty as well that would be paid if I miss out on one of my challenges.
Please find such a list hereafter:

### Become Happy - Choose the Banana more Often
Imagine your vision of what you want to be in a year is to lose 5 kg, learn a new language, and get promoted at work.
You can achieve this by setting up a routine schedule as presented above, run 7km, eat fast food only once a week, sleep routinely and deeply, and thus make all the little decisions that guide you there! Try it out and let me know how it went for you.

__Did you choose the banana?__
