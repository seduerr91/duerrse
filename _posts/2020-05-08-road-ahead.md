# Introduction

- One year of time as a gift of Austria > they are doing the right thing
- Financial resources > working as a bank manager for two years, enough to survive for one year
- Interest in deep neural network structures > learned how to code, from team tree house to fast.ai to data camp, to MIT?
- Where to get motivation? Three videos: smiley, Alan watts, and Hawaii video

# Setting up a strategy - where do you want to be in 2025?
- Your linked in profile
- What do you love to do? How can you scale that?

# Deducting a vision for a year, slicing and concluding tasks from it.

# The hint: Ask people, and learn from their mistakes, reach out for them.

# Ingredients of a roadmap
## Content.
## Temporal.
## Spatial.

# Following up on your milestones;  making sure to succeed; bet buddies as well as external commitment (this blog, tweet every day).

# The importance of loving yourself to love others. 
It is our environ that helps us. 
Spatial segregation in a house.

# Conclusion:
At the beginning, but running marathon in isolation, climbing 6088m, and learning to code within one year certainly reflect my stubbornness.

Thank you for following me.
