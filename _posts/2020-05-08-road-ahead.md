## Introduction

After having been working for 52 weeks within the last 24 months, you automatically qualify to take a study leave ("Bildungskarenz") in the country of Austria. What is that? A Bildungskarenz allows you to retrieve your unemployment benefits, and to educate yourself in whatever your employer deems relevant to your ordinary duties. The hardest is to get the signature of your supervisor. Additionally, your employer has to allow you back into your former position (or a likewise) continuing your former contract. On May 1, 2021, I will have to return.
This possibility is just so smart of Austria. It allows their citizens to get acquainted with modern technologies, increases the cognitive flexibility, and, hence, overally has a positive impact on the country. 

Last year in August, I chose to also ask for a Bildungskarenz. My employer was not really entertained in the beginning and it needed some back and forth but eventually they could not "say no", and so I scheduled my plans to start on May 1, 2020. 

Combining my unemployment benefits with my former responsibility as a senior manager at the biggest Austrian bank, I am equipped with financial resources but how do you operationalize a year of time? What do you do in order to make sure not to waste it? What do you want to do in live? What is your inspirations? It is hard to answer these questions but with the help of some guidance, and my skills in project planning, I carved out a roadmap that I deem necessary.

However, how do you start with this? There are truly some very inspirational thinkers out there that may rise some questions you have to consider find the resources below. But I really asked myself: do I want to continue right now the way I am? It is so comfortable, it is so cozy but is this the end? What about you? Are you still excited every day?

My favorite motivation videos these days:
* [Alan Watts asks "What do you desire?"](https://vimeo.com/60087670), 
* [Adam talking about quarterlife crises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddek3gQVt9Y), 
* [Beautiful Hawaii](https://youtu.be/L3V7LKYPIUQ).

## My interests gear me towards my strategy

So ask yourself? What do you like? What makes you tick? 
- Traveling, coding, sports.
- Interest in deep neural network structures > learned h ow to code, from team tree house to fast.ai to data camp, to MIT?
- Where to get motivation? Three videos: smiley, Alan watts, and Hawaii video

## Setting up a strategy - where do you want to be in 2025?
- Your linked in profile
- What do you love to do? How can you scale that?

## Deducting a vision for a year, slicing and concluding tasks from it.

## The hint: Ask people, and learn from their mistakes, reach out for them.

## Ingredients of a roadmap
### Content.
### Temporal.
### Spatial.

## Following up on your milestones;  making sure to succeed; bet buddies as well as external commitment (this blog, tweet every day).

## The importance of loving yourself to love others. 
It is our environ that helps us. 
Spatial segregation in a house.

## Conclusion:
At the beginning, but running marathon in isolation, climbing 6088m, and learning to code within one year certainly reflect my stubbornness.

Thank you for following me.
