Do you want to make sure that the recipient of your email understands you? Do you want to get a positive response to your email? Then you have to write for your recipients, not for yourself. In other words: "__Be a mirror__"

Resonating can be as easy as repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has written. Subconsciously, we fear what is different and find comfort in similarity. We even have seen this ourselves in an experimental study that we conducted([read the study here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12454)) at MIT. In this study, we conclude that successfully written persuasiveness relates to the "alignment of tonal formality, emotionality, and comprehensiveness with a recipient in a structured and logically coherent manner in a text." ([Duerr et al. 2021, page 7](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12454.pdf))

Oh yeah :woman_facepalming: how researchy! Let us try to explain this definition a bit more understandable. 
Resonating with your recipient can be achieved with three simple things:

- __Formality__ which is the degree of how formal someone's text is.
- __Emotionality__ by which it is meant what type of person are you writing to.
- __Comprehensiveness__ relates to how you can understand someone's writing.

Firstly,  __Formality__. You must have been in this situation when someone official wrote 'Dear Mrs.' and ended in 'Kind regards.' That is easy to mimic because you simply copy that formal style. However, imagine a professor sent you an email and started with 'Hi there' and finished with 'Sincerely yours' - What do you do now? 
Do you copy his informal style or do you try to be formal? Here it is key to mirror this professor. If you copy her style, you are not making a mistake but embracing their informality with kindness. It will help! 

The second aspect is __Emotionality__. Let us look at it from a psychological perspective. Imagine that you are writing to an introvert ([25-40% of humans are introverts](https://www.verywellmind.com/signs-you-are-an-introvert-2795427)). How would you do that? Well, the solution is you would write more emotionally neutral or authoritative. For extroverts, you would find an activating or positive for style. Let us give you an example: A study from [2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093650220961965) found that the following sentences resonated better with extroverts, respectively introverts in the Netherlands.

Lastly, __Comprehensiveness__. You want to be understood! How can you be understood? Well the simple approach is: use short and consise words that everybody understands. Read [here](www.duerr.se/blog/tools) how AI can help you with that. However, what do you do if your recipient writes in a rather complicated way? 
Let us imagine that you are writing to a Ph.D. that loves to use some complex and intellectual language (right? who borrows from academic phrasing such as intellectual? :grinning:). What to do? Firstly, get an idea how your writing compares to his. Secondly, follow mirroring again. Thus, you want to make sure you write equally complex as your recipient because you write for them. Not yourself.
