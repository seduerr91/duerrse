- Definition of a Linguistic Realizer

Step 1: Find the Tokens with Spacy

- Use PAWS / random corpus as base
- Use Spacy to identify all relevant tokens (nouns, pronouns)

Core Algorithm:

Step 2: Create Masked Dataset with Masked Sentences / Target

Core Algorithm:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/seduerr91/b1cebf4f2565615093a0c775d2dbc504.js"></script>

And Divide into Test, Train, Eval - Set

Step 3: Training!
- Feed Masked Dataset to T5 Model

Step 4: Inference with a Target Set
- Define Target BoW to accept as generated results



Step 5: Look into the Model and get the Probabilities
- Find probabilities for generated results for accepting / rejecting.

Step 6: With verbs take the Lemma!
