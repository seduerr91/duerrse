This article introduces the following findings:
- my experiences with different object detection and tracking tools,
- with a focus on PlantCV's functionalities,
- links the new videos I created for further analysis, and
- links to my concept for the next project steps.

### Object detection and tracking tools

Algorithm name | plantCV | MeanShift & Kalman | GoodFeaturesToTrack
---|---|---|---
Use Case|Designed for detecting plants and their pieces.|For moving objects such as cars or human faces.|For recognizing edges. Not for entire object detection.
Tracking Quality|n/a|[Video](https://youtu.be/jEMJBbI2GJI)|[Video](https://youtu.be/A84SOP-tgoY)

Conclusion:
- GoodFeaturesToTrack by far the best to spot results and to track movement on an stationary camera.
- PlantCV allows to determine specific plant related features.

### Introduction to PlantCV

[PlantCVs](https://plantcv.readthedocs.io/en) allows to detect plants and a lot of features of them:

Given this bare plant, I detected the plant properties and the structure of the plant.

#### Bare Structure

PlantCV also allows to determine the branch points or the leaf path lenghts.

#### Leaf Path Lengths

Additionally, you can detect the leaf color patterns, potentially inferencing a plants' health.

### Videos for Further Research Setups

In order to conduct further analysis, I made videos with two different basils. One was old and already close to his end of life, while the other one was a *bio* basil, freshly bought. I did two rounds with more leaves and with less leaves on the basils for tracking purposes. Find the videos behind the the links in the table.

The following table links to the new basil videos. The are produced with the alternating sounds (happy, unhappy) from the RAVDESS data set, and 10s pause.

### Project concept 'Show me your basil'

In order to further develop plant happiness project, I drafted a research [concept](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FjNXeMPaLJNyggLKS7OI0_XcHgBqT_vz/view?usp=sharing) for the next upcoming months.
