In order to further advance on the plant happiness project, the following overview informs about the status quo, and the next steps (please find related literature, sources, and the concept as a powerpoint at the end of this article).

#### Status Quo - What do we know?

In the following, my findings of the recent four weeks are presented:
- my exploratory results with different object detection and tracking algorithms,
- an introduction to relevant PlantCV functionalities, and
- links the new videos I created for further analysis.

### Object detection and tracking tools

Algorithm name | plantCV | MeanShift & Kalman | GoodFeaturesToTrack
---|---|---|---
Use Case|Designed for detecting plants and their pieces.|For moving objects such as cars or human faces.|For recognizing edges. Not for entire object detection.
Tracking Preview|n/a|[Video](https://youtu.be/jEMJBbI2GJI)|[Video](https://youtu.be/A84SOP-tgoY)

Conclusion:
- GoodFeaturesToTrack the best to spot results and to track movement on an stationary camera.
- PlantCV allows to determine specific plant related features, which can be found in the following.

### Introduction to PlantCV

[PlantCVs](https://plantcv.readthedocs.io/en) allows to detect plants and a lot of features of them:

Given this bare plant, plant properties and the structure of the plant can be detected.

#### Bare Structure

PlantCV also allows to determine the branch points or the leaf path lengths.

#### Leaf Path Lengths

Additionally, the leaf color patterns can be detected, potentially inferencing a plants' health.

### Videos for Further Research Setups
For analysis of basil performance, videos with two different basils were created. The unhealthy one was old and already close to his end of life, while the healthy one was one a *bio* basil, purchased the prior day. Two rounds of filming took place with more leaves and with less leaves on the basils for tracking purposes.

#### Unhealthy Basil

The videos are produced with alternating emotion sounds (happy, unhappy) from the RAVDESS data set, and 10s pause in between two auditive stimulations.
